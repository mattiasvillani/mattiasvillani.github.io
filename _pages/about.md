I got my PhD in Statistics in 2000 from [Stockholm University](https://www.su.se/department-of-statistics/) on the topic Bayesian Cointegration with the brilliant Daniel Thorburn as supervisor. 

After my post doc, I was senior lecturer at Stockholm University (2003-2011) and researcher and advisor at the Swedish central bank (2004-2011), where I was part of a team that developed the two main models for macroeconomic forecasting and policy analysis.

I was Professor of Statistics at Link√∂ping University in 2011-2023, spending time building up the [Statistics and Machine Learning](https://liu.se/en/organisation/liu/ida/stima) division and expanded my range in statistical applications to neuroimaging, robotics and transportation. 

Since 2018 I am back at my alma mater Stockholm University, where I hold the Professor chair of Statistics. 

I currently serve as associate editor for [Bayesian Analysis](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/bayesian-analysis) (2020-) and have previously been associate editor for [Econometrics & Statistics](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/econometrics-and-statistics) (2015-2022).

I enjoy programming, especially when I get to use the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) programming language. More recently, I have started to explore Javascript and [Observable](https://observablehq.com/) for interactive/reactive visualizations.
